Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    The difference is that inline-element is that they can begin within a new line, and they dont start in a new line.  The block element is in contrast. they start in a new line on a webpage, most elements are block elements

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
